| **Criterion**                                       | **Score** | **Comments**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Requirement coverage**                         | 5 | The schema fully covers required features: users, private/group/public conversations via `conversation_type`, message read/delivery tracking, attachments for media/files, and join/leave semantics through `user_conversation`. Every functional requirement is represented.                           |
| **2. Modeling correctness & normalization**         | 5 | Clean 3NF structure with logical separation of concerns (`users`, `conversations`, `messages`, `message_receiver`, etc.). Lookup tables (`conversation_type`, `message_status`, `message_receiver_status`, `user_conversation_role`) improve extensibility. Relationships and FKs are well thought out. |
| **3. Scalability & performance**                    | 4 | Notes demonstrate strong understanding of indexing, partitioning, caching, and sharding. Mentions Redis, Kafka, and cold storage migration. However, lacks explicit partitioning strategy or denormalized read model for high-scale reads.                                                              |
| **4. Status & temporal events**                     | 5 | Robust tracking of message lifecycle with sender (`message_status`) and receiver (`message_receiver_status`) tables. `join_timestamp` ensures message visibility correctness. Fully supports temporal logic.                                                                                            |
| **5. Security & multi-tenancy**                     | 4 | Excellent coverage in proposal—JWT, bcrypt, TLS, signed URLs, RBAC via roles. Mentions RLS-like control but no tenant_id or per-tenant schema described, so not fully multi-tenant ready.                                                                                                               |
| **6. Files / multimedia handling**                  | 5 | Attachments table includes `file_url`, `mime_type`, `size`, `uploaded_at`, and proposal describes CDN + signed URL strategy. Meets all file-sharing and multimedia requirements robustly.                                                                                                               |
| **7. Group membership semantics & history**         | 5 | `user_conversation` and `user_conversation_role` track membership, join timestamp, and roles (admin/member). Supports join/leave visibility and permissions effectively.                                                                                                                                |
| **8. Public channels semantics**                    | 4 | `conversation_type` supports “public” as an enum. Proposal assumes application-level ACL enforcement (read-all, write-restricted). Database-level enforcement could strengthen guarantees.                                                                                                              |
| **9. Operational considerations / maintainability** | 4 | Strong operational design: mentions CI/CD, monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana), backups, partitioning, and blue-green deploys. Could be improved with automated schema migration/rollback details.                                                                                                         |
| **10. Clarity of notes & reasoning**                | 5 | Notes are detailed, structured, and clearly communicate reasoning. Includes SQL snippets, indexing strategy, and trade-off analysis. Demonstrates mature understanding and professional communication.                                                                                                  |

**Remarks:**
The submission demonstrates mature database design and system thinking. The schema elegantly handles all business requirements, with extensibility for production scenarios. The notes and proposal files reflect architectural depth, security awareness, and operational foresight. Minor operational and multi-tenancy specifics could be expanded, but overall, this is an excellent and production-grade submission.

**Total**
Score: 46 / 50 (Strong Pass with 92%)
