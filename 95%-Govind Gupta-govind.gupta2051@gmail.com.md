| **Aspect**                                                      | **Score (out of 5)** | **Detailed Evaluation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Core requirement coverage (user entity)**                  | **5**                | `User` table correctly includes `id`, `username`, `password`, and `active`. Naming and typing conventions are consistent. Fully compliant with the baseline requirement.                                                                               |
| **2. Private conversations (1-to-1)**                           | **5**                | `Conversation` and `Message` entities model this well. Relationship between users and conversations is clearly defined, allowing one-to-one conversations.                                                                                             |
| **3. Group conversations (multi-user)**                         | **4.5**              | Group chats are supported via a `conversation_participants` bridge table with join/leave tracking. Covers group membership, but message visibility filtering (no messages before join) is assumed application-side — acceptable given 60-minute scope. |
| **4. Public conversations (channels)**                          | **4**                | `Conversation.type` enum includes a “public” value, so channel semantics are represented. No explicit database-level ACL for “read all, write members only” — but the intent is clear.                                                                 |
| **5. Message delivery & reading status**                        | **5**                | Separate status tracking tables (`message_delivery_status`, `message_read_status`) exist with timestamps. Models delivery and read history fully.                                                                                                      |
| **6. File sharing / multimedia support**                        | **5**                | `MediaFiles` or equivalent attachment table includes metadata (file path, MIME type, thumbnail, etc.). Fully addresses the “file & multimedia message” requirement.                                                                                    |
| **7. Scalability & performance awareness**                      | **4**                | The schema is normalized and indexes are implied. Reasoning mentions horizontal scalability and caching but does not go deep into partitioning or archiving policies — sufficient for 60-min submission.                                               |
| **8. Notes.md reasoning quality**                               | **5**                | Clearly discusses SQL vs NoSQL trade-offs, rationale for relational choice, assumptions, and mitigation of weaknesses. Covers every bullet point in the instructions.                                                                                  |
| **9. Proposal.md architectural suggestions**                    | **5**                | Provides practical recommendations for each driver — *security*, *availability*, and *reliability/robustness*. Suggestions are realistic and clearly connected to the database design.                                                                 |
| **10. Scope appropriateness / completeness under 60-min limit** | **5**                | Design is ambitious but coherent, within what a skilled engineer could produce in one hour. Proper balance between completeness and clarity.                                                                                                           |

## Remarks:
  The candidate’s submission fully meets all stated business rules and goes beyond minimum expectations with thoughtful modeling of delivery, read, and file handling. The notes and proposal files directly answer all required prompts. A very strong submission — near-ideal for the given scope. Minor deduction only because public-channel permissions and message visibility logic are delegated to the application layer rather than explicitly enforced in DB.

## Final Score: 47.5 / 50 (Excellent Pass with 95% )
