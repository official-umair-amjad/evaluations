| **Criterion**                                       | **Score** | **Comments**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Requirement coverage**                         | 3         | Covers essential messaging features: private/group chat, media, reactions, and participant tracking. However, no explicit read/delivery receipts or per-user message visibility fields are implemented. Notes mention “read status,” but it’s not represented in schema. and not followed naming conventions mentioned                            |
| **2. Modeling correctness & normalization**         | 4         | Schema is normalized and clear, with strong separation (`chat`, `messages`, `chat_users`, `message_reactions`, `media`). The relationships are well defined. However, the `is_group` and `is_private` booleans in `chat` could be replaced by a single `type` enum for cleaner semantics.           |
| **3. Scalability & performance**                    | 4         | Notes demonstrate understanding of indexing, read/write pools, and partitioning. Acknowledges potential high SQL traffic and proposes separation of read/write DBs. Could improve by specifying exact indexing and partitioning strategy for `messages` (e.g., range partitioning by chat_id/date). |
| **4. Status & temporal events**                     | 3         | No explicit `message_status` table or timestamps for delivery/read tracking. `last_read_message` in `chat_users` helps, but lacks granularity for per-message or per-recipient tracking. Notes mention “read status” but not mapped in schema.                                                      |
| **5. Security & multi-tenancy**                     | 4         | Notes show strong understanding: encryption at rest and transit, JWT/OAuth, RBAC, and secret management. However, schema lacks multi-tenant isolation fields (e.g., tenant_id/org_id). No RLS or per-chat access control in schema.                                                                 |
| **6. Files / multimedia handling**                  | 4         | `media` table correctly separates files from messages. Mentions cloud storage (S3) and encryption, which is good. Missing metadata fields (e.g., MIME type, size, version). The linkage between `media` and `messages` could be clearer (foreign key not shown in diagram).                         |
| **7. Group membership semantics & history**         | 4         | `chat_users` contains `joined_at` and `last_read_message`, enabling temporal filtering. However, no `left_at` or `is_active` column, limiting accurate history reconstruction (rejoins, visibility of old messages).                                                                                |
| **8. Public channels semantics**                    | 3         | The schema uses booleans (`is_group`, `is_private`), but lacks a clear model for public channels or broadcast logic. Notes mention future extensibility but not database enforcement for public vs private visibility.                                                                              |
| **9. Operational considerations / maintainability** | 4         | Proposal demonstrates solid DevOps awareness — Docker, K8s, CI/CD, observability, fault tolerance, async queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ). Missing discussion of migrations, schema evolution, and data retention automation (archiving old messages).                                                       |
| **10. Clarity of notes & reasoning**                | 5         | Notes and proposal are articulate, grounded in practical system design thinking. The structure is logical, touches on security, performance, and scalability comprehensively. Some small grammar issues but clearly human-written and conceptually strong.                                          |

The design is clean, well-reasoned, and shows strong real-world understanding. The schema covers most functional requirements, though message statuses and public-channel logic could be more explicit. Notes and proposal files demonstrate clear awareness of scalability, security, and operational reliability.
