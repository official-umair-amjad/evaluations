| **Criterion**                                        | **Score (out of 5)** | **Comments**                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Requirement Coverage**                          | **5**                | Fully meets required chat types (private, group, public) and features (delivery, read, attachments, user management). All main cases explicitly addressed in notes and schema. |
| **2. Modeling Correctness & Normalization**          | **5**                | Schema is well-normalized; junction tables (participants, deliveries, reads) correctly handle many-to-many relations. Keys and constraints show deep relational understanding. |
| **3. Scalability & Performance**                     | **4**              | Excellent awareness of scaling via partitioning, indexes, caching, CQRS. Lacks deeper quantitative or sharding strategy details, but otherwise robust.                         |
| **4. Status & Temporal Events**                      | **5**                | Separate `message_deliveries`, `message_delivery_events`, and `message_reads` accurately capture temporal and per-recipient state. Well-structured auditability.               |
| **5. Security & Multi-Tenancy**                      | **4.5**              | Good security section (bcrypt, JWT, RBAC, TLS). Slightly generic multi-tenancy treatment — assumes single tenant but scalable pattern implied.                                 |
| **6. Files / Multimedia Handling**                   | **5**                | Clean separation via `attachments` table, object storage references, and metadata columns. Includes checksum/dimensions for validation. Excellent.                             |
| **7. Group Membership Semantics & History**          | **5**                | `participants` with `joined_at`, `left_at`, and `kicked_by` perfectly model history and visibility rules. Logical constraints prevent inconsistent states.                     |
| **8. Public Channels Semantics**                     | **4.5**              | Uses `visibility` and `post_policy` enums with clear access logic. Could mention moderation or indexing concerns for large public channels, but conceptually sound.            |
| **9. Documentation (notes.md & proposal.md)**        | **5**                | Extremely detailed, logically structured, clearly human-written. Justifications, trade-offs, and relational reasoning are strong. No AI-style repetition detected.             |
| **10. Overall Clarity, Reasoning & Professionalism** | **5**                | Reads like senior-level technical design: precise terminology, clear structure, realistic architectural trade-offs, complete alignment between ERD and narrative.              |
