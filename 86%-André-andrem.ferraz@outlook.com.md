| **Criterion**                                        | Score | **Comments**                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Requirement Coverage**                          | 5     | Fully satisfies all stated requirements — private, group, and public conversations; message delivery/read tracking; file sharing. The schema precisely models the required behaviors. |
| **2. Modeling Correctness & Normalization**          | 5     | Strongly normalized (3NF+). Tables are logically separated with well-defined relationships and referential integrity. Proper use of foreign keys and composite indexes.               |
| **3. Scalability & Performance**                     | 4     | Clear awareness of scaling considerations and indexing strategy. Could expand with explicit query optimization or partitioning strategy for very large datasets.                      |
| **4. Status & Temporal Events**                      | 5     | Correctly models message visibility, delivery, and read statuses with proper timestamps. Handles “joined after message sent” logic correctly.                                         |
| **5. Security & Multi-Tenancy**                      | 4     | Excellent mention of encryption and access control; lacks explicit `tenant_id` or schema isolation for multi-tenant setups.                                                           |
| **6. Files / Multimedia Handling**                   | 5     | Perfect use of separate attachment table with metadata, avoiding blobs in DB. Includes support for thumbnails, signed URLs, and CDN storage.                                          |
| **7. Group Membership Semantics & History**          | 5     | Robust membership lifecycle design with `joined_at`, `left_at`, and `is_active`. Covers all business cases.                                                                           |
| **8. Public Channels Semantics**                     | 4     | Supports public channels via conversation type and permissions; could add moderation/audit elements.                                                                                  |
| **9. Documentation (notes.md & proposal.md)**        | 3     | Well-structured and technically sound, but tone and phrasing indicate heavy AI assistance (~80% AI-written). Deducted 2 marks for authenticity.                                       |
| **10. Overall Clarity, Reasoning & Professionalism** | 3     | Presentation and design rationale are exceptionally clear and detailed, though slightly over-formal due to AI-style phrasing.                                                         |

This submission reflects strong architectural and database design skill, with an understanding of scalability, normalization, and system-level design.
However, documentation (notes.md and proposal.md) reads as 80–90% AI-assisted, lacking the subtle imperfections and reflective reasoning expected in human-authored design notes.

Final Score: 43/50 (Strong Pass with 86%)
