| **Criterion**                                        | **Score (out of 5)** | **Comments**                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Requirement Coverage**                          | **5**                | Fully covers private, group, and public conversations, delivery/read status, and file/media management. Meets all requirements comprehensively.   |
| **2. Modeling Correctness & Normalization**          | **4.5**                | Schema is well-structured and normalized. Relational integrity handled well; minor concern with `list_of_media_files` array consistency.          |
| **3. Scalability & Performance**                     | **5**                | Excellent scalability planning with hybrid SQL+NoSQL setup, sharding, caching, and indexing. Clear understanding of large-scale message handling. |
| **4. Status & Temporal Events**                      | **4**                | Delivery/read timestamps modeled clearly; asynchronous flow explained. Could add more detail on message ordering or sequence handling.            |
| **5. Security & Multi-Tenancy**                      | **4.5**                | Strong coverage of encryption, hashing, TLS, and DDoS prevention. Multi-tenancy is implied but not explicitly modeled.                            |
| **6. Files / Multimedia Handling**                   | **5**                | Excellent design — metadata in DB, files in CDN/S3, signed URLs, proper mime and size tracking. Production-grade approach.                        |
| **7. Group Membership Semantics & History**          | **5**                | Lifecycle tracking (`joined_at`, `left_at`, `is_active`) well-designed and properly reasoned.                                                     |
| **8. Public Channels Semantics**                     | **4**                | Public access rules defined correctly, but lacks direct enforcement model (e.g., RLS or ACL).                                                     |
| **9. Documentation (notes.md & proposal.md)**        | **5**                | Clear, detailed, and well-reasoned documentation. Shows deep understanding and original analysis.                                                 |
| **10. Overall Clarity, Reasoning & Professionalism** | **5**                | Highly professional, technically sound, and clearly structured. Excellent understanding of trade-offs and system design.                          |
