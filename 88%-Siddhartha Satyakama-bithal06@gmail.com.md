| **Criterion**                                       | **Score** | **Comments**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **1. Requirement coverage**                         | 5         | The schema comprehensively models all messenger application features: users, conversations (private/group/public), participants with role and permissions, messages with attachments, read/delivery statuses, and message content separation. Every major functional requirement is captured.           |
| **2. Modeling correctness & normalization**         | 5         | Schema is normalized (3NF+) with clear separation between message metadata, content, delivery, and read tracking. Logical foreign keys and composite indexes are defined consistently. The `MESSAGE_CONTENT` table optimizes content storage while maintaining relational integrity.                    |
| **3. Scalability & performance**                    | 4       | Strong indexing strategy demonstrates awareness of real-world query loads and scalability. Notes include detailed indexing and partitioning considerations, as well as caching and sharding strategies. Could benefit from an explicit read-optimized denormalized table for extreme scaling scenarios. |
| **4. Status & temporal events**                     | 4         | Robust dual-status tracking (delivery vs read) allows precise temporal state transitions. Proper timestamps on participant joins and message sending ensure accurate message visibility. Clearly supports “messages visible after join time” use case.                                                  |
| **5. Security & multi-tenancy**                     | 4      | Excellent proposal-level coverage: end-to-end encryption (Signal Protocol), RBAC, MFA, and TLS at every layer. Clear separation between client-secret data and encrypted payloads. Lacks explicit multi-tenant separation (e.g., `tenant_id` or schema-based isolation).                                |
| **6. Files / multimedia handling**                  | 5         | Uses `MESSAGE_ATTACHMENT` table with metadata, URLs, and thumbnail support, backed by CDN and S3. Correctly avoids blob storage in DB. Incorporates validation, signed URLs, and cacheability principles.                                                                                               |
| **7. Group membership semantics & history**         | 5         | `CONVERSATION_PARTICIPANT` provides full membership lifecycle tracking (`joined_at`, `left_at`, `is_active`, `can_send_messages`). Perfectly supports auditability and visibility logic.                                                                                                                |
| **8. Public channels semantics**                    | 4      | Public channels supported through `conversation_type` with role-based permissions (`can_send_messages`). Conceptually solid; could further detail public channel moderation or broadcast optimizations.                                                                                                 |
| **9. Operational considerations / maintainability** | 4         | Proposal exhibits enterprise-grade operational thinking: zero-downtime deployments, automated migrations, HA/DR planning, caching layers, and observability stack (Prometheus, ELK, Jaeger). Clear blue-green strategy and chaos testing demonstrate maturity.                                          |
| **10. Clarity of notes & reasoning**                | 4         | The documentation (notes.md and proposal.md) is exceptionally structured, clearly articulating trade-offs, assumptions, and mitigations. It reads like a professional design document—concise, technical, and well-argued.                                                                              |

## Remarks:
  The submission demonstrates exceptional system design maturity. The database model is both elegant and practical, grounded in operational reality and scaling foresight. The supporting documentation reflects deep expertise in relational modeling, security, and distributed system architecture. Minor improvements could include explicit multi-tenancy isolation and public channel scalability specifics, but overall, this work is outstanding.

  The notes.md and proposal.md is 80% likely written with AI with little human involvements so subtracted a little marks for that 2 marks are deducted, else solution was very good

## Score if non-ai Total Score: 47 / 50 (Excelent Pass with 95%)
## Score as AI is involved Total Score: 44 / 50 (Excelent Pass with 88%)
