| **Criterion**                                       | **Score** | **Comments**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Requirement coverage**                         | 4   | Covers all required entities: users, conversations (personal, group, public), members, messages, and delivery statuses. Includes media support through `MediaURL`. However, lacks explicit handling for message reading status (only delivery is represented).                                               |
| **2. Modeling correctness & normalization**         | 4.5   | Well-structured and normalized. Foreign keys are clear, with good use of ENUMs and join tables for many-to-many relationships. The `ConversationMembers` table properly captures join/leave times and roles. Minor improvement: avoid ENUMs if expecting frequent role expansion (use lookup table instead). |
| **3. Scalability & performance**                    | 4     | Notes mention indexing, sharding, and caching — a solid start. However, no mention of partitioning large tables (like `Messages`) or async message processing pipelines. SQL choice is justified but could include hybrid consideration earlier.                                                             |
| **4. Status & temporal events**                     | 4     | The `MessageDeliveryStatuses` table captures message lifecycle well, but missing a distinct *reading status* entity or flag. Otherwise, timestamps (`JoinedAt`, `LeftAt`, `Timestamp`) are well-integrated.                                                                                                  |
| **5. Security & multi-tenancy**                     | 4     | Proposal addresses encryption (E2E + TLS) and MFA clearly. However, no `tenant_id` or schema separation is proposed — which limits scalability for multi-tenant systems. Security fundamentals are strong though.                                                                                            |
| **6. Files / multimedia handling**                  | 4.5   | Supports media and file sharing via `MediaURL` and `MessageType`. Would be stronger if storage backend or CDN design (like signed URLs or S3 integration) were mentioned.                                                                                                                                    |
| **7. Group membership semantics & history**         | 5     | Excellent. Tracks `JoinedAt`, `LeftAt`, and `Role` — enabling visibility rules like “messages before join are hidden.” Well aligned with business requirements.                                                                                                                                              |
| **8. Public channels semantics**                    | 4     | Uses `ConversationType` ENUM for public, group, personal. Works fine but could include more explicit role-based control or moderation handling for public channels.                                                                                                                                          |
| **9. Operational considerations / maintainability** | 4     | Notes discuss caching, sharding, read replicas — good awareness of scaling. Lacks mention of schema migrations, monitoring, or CI/CD DB practices.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **10. Clarity of notes & reasoning**                | 4   | Notes and proposal are clearly written, logically structured, and coherent. However, the phrasing and uniform tone suggest moderate AI assistance (estimated **70–80% AI-generated**). Deduct minor marks as per evaluation policy.                                                                          |


## This is a strong, well-structured SQL schema showing a solid understanding of relational modeling, message tracking, and user roles.
Strengths: Logical relationships, delivery tracking, and strong notes on consistency and scaling.
Improvements: Add explicit message reading tracking, include storage/CDN structure for files, and minor expansion on operational maturity.

The written documents are clear but somewhat AI-polished, resulting in a slightly generic narrative tone. A light mark deduction was applied for that.

## Total Score 42 / 50 (Good Pass with 84%)
